# Contributing to June âœ¨

All contributions are welcome: reporting bugs, suggesting improvements, creating art, music, documentation, or code.  
Before everything, always check if there's already an issue about what you want to talk about.

## Reporting Bugs

- Open an issue with a clear title.
- Describe the steps to reproduce the issue.
- Include screenshots, logs, or videos if necessary.

## Suggesting Improvements

- Open a new Issue and use a descriptive title (e.g., "Add new beat synchronization mechanic").
- In the Issue body, describe:
  - The problem or need the feature solves.
  - How the feature can improve gameplay or experience.
  - Possible challenges or limitations.
- If possible, include examples.
  - Mockups, drawings, simple prototypes, or reference links.
  - Mechanics from other games that inspired your idea.
